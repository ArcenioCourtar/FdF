# FdF
My version of the 42's FdF project. It takes a map with coordinates and draws the map's coordinates on the screen in isometrict projection.
Currently compiles on Linux and Codam Macs. I haven't tested it on other Macs or 42 systems.  
Don't forget ot `init` and `update` the MLX42 submodule before trying `make`!

### Manual
Pass one of the maps from the `maps` folder as an additional argument when running the executable.  
Adding the word `BONUS` as an argument after the map will color the map's nodes based on height.  
Zoom in/out with W/S. Move around with the arrow keys.

(Will add screenshots later)
